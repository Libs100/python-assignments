# ðŸ§¬ DNA Sequence Analysis Tool ðŸ§¬

## Overview
Analyze DNA sequences with style and precision! This tool provides the following features:
1. **Longest Repeated Subsequence**: Find the longest repeated subsequence in your DNA.
2. **GC Content Analysis**: Calculate the percentage of G and C nucleotides.
3. **Palindromic Sequence Count**: Count the number of palindromic sequences in your DNA (e.g., sequences that read the same forwards and backwards).

## Requirements
- Install the required library:
  ```bash
  pip install biopython
